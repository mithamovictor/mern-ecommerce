# MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS (MERN) E-Commerce site
This is an ecommerce website that has been developed using the MERN structure and can be used as a template for small e-commerce websites. :fire: :fire: :fire:

## Setup
To run the project for development start by cloning the project locally.
install node my running ```npm install``` on the root folder to install base dependencies and then run ```npm run setup``` to install core dependencies for the client and server modules.

Set up your **_.env_** variables in the server folder.

Spin up the project by running ```npm start``` this will fire up both the client and server concurrently.

Happy Coding! :smiley:
